## Hi 👋, I’m ***@rubinoWhoDev***  

📚 I'm a Computer Science student, currently attending the third year at University of Catania.  
👨‍💻 I’m interested in Software Development, specifically Game, Web and Mobile development.  
📫 You can reach me at: rubino.r@studium.unict.it  

On my GitHub page you will find both personal projects and programs I wrote during my student carreer _(more coming I guess)_.
### 💻 Projects I'm proud of:
- 🃏 [Briscola Card Game for 5 players](https://github.com/rubinoWhoDev/briscola5pp)
- ⛳ [2D Golf physics simulator](https://github.com/rubinoWhoDev/Glof)
- 🎧 [Database for a Music Streaming Service](https://github.com/rubinoWhoDev/dmimusic-db)
- 🕹 [Hanged Man game over UDP sockets](https://github.com/rubinoWhoDev/impiccato_udp)
